    "\n",
    "1. Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a single file containing Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables. It can also include runnable code.\n",
    "Example: math.py is a module that provides mathematical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Package:\n",
    "\n",
    "A package is a collection of modules organized in directories that include a special __init__.py file. This file can be empty or execute initialization code for the package.\n",
    "Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace using dot notation.\n",
    "Example: numpy is a package that contains multiple modules for numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Library:\n",
    "\n",
    "A library is a collection of modules and packages that provide a set of functionalities. Libraries are broader in scope and can include multiple packages and modules.\n",
    "Example: The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules and packages that come with Python, providing a wide range of functionalities."
